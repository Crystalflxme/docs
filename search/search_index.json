Editing the client's chat options is made easy by the way ChatPlus works. Some values can be changed dynamically and they update in real-time. For example, if you changed the font under BubbleChat, the next chat bubble that is created will fit that formatting. The only difference is to edit these values dynamically you have to edit a folder in ReplicatedStorage generated by ChatPlus that defaults to these settings found here. For the values that are not dynamic (marked with \"Not Dynamic\"), like BubbleChat's enabled property, they do not update on the client when you change their value in ReplicatedStorage. They are values only checked on server start. Editing them is this simple and can be done on any server script: local ReplicatedStorage = game : GetService ( \"ReplicatedStorage\" ) local ClientChatOptions = ReplicatedStorage : WaitForChild ( \"ClientChatOptions\" ) -- Make sure to use WaitForChild! -- Try chatting now and you'll see that the bubble chat will look like the settings you have in the module wait ( 8 ) ClientChatOptions .

TextColor = Color3 . fromRBG ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) print ( \"Changed the client chat options!\" ) -- Now, if you chat, the chat bubble will have red text and the Arcade font! Make sure to keep in mind that editing these values isn't like the table in the module! You are editing value instances, so you have to add a .Value to edit them correctly (as seen in the example above). For Enum values, make sure to refer to their string name! Enum . Font . Arcade .

They can be seen below. Fun Fact If you would like a direct reference to the system/server SpeakerPlus object that's built into ChatPlus, you can reference \"ChatPlus.SystemMessenger\" to get it. Warning Please do not edit the value called \"BuildNum\" in the Main script because it's used to check if the system is out of date. If you want to stick with an older version you might want to enable \"DisableUpdateChecker\" in the system settings. ChatPlus Formatting ChatPlus uses a special formatting method that is based off of Roblox's default Lua Chat System \"ExtraData\" property. You can read more about the ExtraData property here . All data that can be changed from the ExtraData property transfers to this system. However, there are a few differences in the syntax. Normally, you would do this to change a chat name color: Speaker : SetExtraData ( \"NameColor\" , Color3 . fromRGB ( 255 , 255 , 255 )) But with ChatPlus, you do this instead: { \"NameColor\" , Color3 . fromRGB ( 255 , 255 , 255 )} When placed inside of another table to hold all of the data you want to set, this is known as a ChatPlus FormattingTable It is what the system uses to know how to format chat messages. More examples of FormattingTables can be found here on the examples page . ChatPlus Formatting Priority The Rule of Formatting Priority in ChatPlus When certain formatting has priority over another, the one that doesn't have the priority is not shown at all! The \"Global\" tag under the \"Groups\" table will apply to every single user and bypasses any formatting priority in the group. Gamepasses have the lowest formatting priority and will only show if the user is not in the Users table or in a specified group. If a user is listed under the \"Users\" table, then that formatting will take priority over any other formatting (even groups). Example: If the user is a rank that gets formatting in a group, all if it will be overridden by whatever the user formatting is (even the \"Global\" tag). The group \"Priority\" number represents what groups/gamepasses should take formatting priority over the other. Example: If a user is in more than one group listed the group with more priority (smaller number) will be used for formatting. Ranks without a greater or less than symbol will take priority over formatting that has them. Example: The rank \"250\" formatting would take priority over the \">200\" rank formatting even though it is still true.","title":"System gotchas"},{"location":"chatplus/setup/gotchas/#chatplus-formatting","text":"ChatPlus uses a special formatting method that is based off of Roblox's default Lua Chat System \"ExtraData\" property.
